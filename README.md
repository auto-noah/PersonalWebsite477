# PersonalWebsite477
This is a personal portfolio/resume web application that I produced during my CSE 477 Web Development course.

The website is built with HTML, CSS, & JS and utilizes mySQL and Jinja to store/display backend data to the user. There is online chat functionality that utilizes sockets to let users interact asyncronously. There is also a projects page with a fully integrated piano application, and a link to a wordle clone application that I produced during the course as well.
