# [Web Application Development](https://final-exam2-yoqpwdjonq-uc.a.run.app/home)

This is a personal portfolio/resume web application that I produced during my CSE 477 Web Development course.

The website is built with HTML, CSS, & JS and utilizes Flask, mySQL, and Jinja to route/store/display backend data to the user. There is an online chat function that utilizes sockets to let users interact asyncronously. There is also a projects page with a fully integrated piano application, and a link to a wordle clone application that I produced during the course as well.

## Purpose:

The purpose of producing this web application is to provide hands-on experience with frontend development, backend development, basic security, & authentication and asyncryonous communication technologies for your web application, including:

1. How to write and structure HTML documents.
2. Best practices for styling reactive HTML documents using CSS.
3. Building interactive client-side applications using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
4. Python Flask - a backend for your web application.
5. MySQL - a relational database to store and retrieve data for your application.
